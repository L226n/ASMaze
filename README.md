# ASMaze
A fun little maze generator written in assembly, made in 1 day and then rewritten on the next day to look prettier :)
Uses Wilson's Algorithm (https://weblog.jamisbuck.org/2011/1/20/maze-generation-wilson-s-algorithm) and also a few functions stolen from L3d2
To run just assemble maze.asm, link and then execute
